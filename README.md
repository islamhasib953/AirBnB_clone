# AirBnB Clone Project
### the AirBnB_clone project, a vital component of the software engineering curriculum at Holberton School. This project serves as a comprehensive learning opportunity, delving into fundamental concepts of advanced programming.

### The primary objective of this project is to construct a simplified version of the AirBnB website, with the initial step being the development of a console or command-line interpreter. This console plays a crucial role in managing website objects, facilitating tasks such as creation, retrieval, manipulation, and deletion.

### The project adopts an object-oriented approach, where classes represent various entities, including BaseModel, User, State, City, Amenity, Place, and Review. It's worth noting that all classes inherit from the BaseModel class.

### The console operates on specific commands, allowing users to execute operations such as object creation, display, modification, and deletion. Furthermore, the project incorporates a basic file storage system utilizing the FileStorage class for serialization and deserialization of instances.

### Written in Python, the project is interpreted and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using Python3.
